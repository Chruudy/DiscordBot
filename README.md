# Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot written in Python. It uses the discord.py library to interact with Discord's API and sqlite3 for database management.

The bot tracks user activity in a Discord server, including:

- When a user sends a message
- When a user joins a voice channel
- How long a user spends in a voice channel
- How many messages a user sends in each channel

It also provides commands for users to check their own activity, the activity of others, and the most active channels in the server.
